1,Flood mitigation Currie/Duplin street,"The stormwater drainage canal located between Duplin and Currie Streets in Wallace experiences flooding during major storms and periods of heavy rainfall occurring within a short period of time. Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.
