Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used for a watershed study for the Little Long Creek 2 sub-basin. Components of this study include field investigation, stormwater inventory, H&H modeling, analysis of secondary systems, and the development of a watershed master plan. With the development of the master plan, the city plans to perform cost benefit analysis and priority rankings to aid staff in its implementation. Once completed, the city will be able to prioritize projects to undertake along this watershed. The city plans to fund these projects through an enterprise fund with the development of a stormwater management program and anticipates collecting fees for this program beginning in January 2023. In this project area there are households, businesses, and other public and private entities that will benefit from the completion of this project. ",City of Albemarle,Local Government,Planning,6/15/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Albemarle,Stanly,

Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to incorporate recommendations to upsize pipes and implement other improvements to the area. Areas upstream flood more frequently and the study determined undersized piping in the project area slowed the drainage of those properties. Proposed work includes replacing 150 linear feet of existing pipe with a larger size, enclosing the ditch within Roanoke Colony with drainage pipe with drop inlets, replacing the culvert beneath Roanoke Trail, removing the culvert immediately downstream of the airport property, and regrading/widening the ditch that runs between the Outer Banks SPCA and airport.

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area. Once the infrastructure work is completed, the city will be able to utilize the road more reliably for emergency services. There are households, public and private entities (including a kidney dialysis center), and a nursing facility in the immediate project area.",City of Lumberton,Local Government,Infrastructure,2/28/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,6/2/22,250000.0,250000.0,Lumberton,Robeson,

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan. All residents of the town will benefit from this project. Within the immediate project area there are households, businesses, other public and private entities, and health care providers that will benefit from this project.",Town of Maxton,Local Government,Planning,7/7/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,122500.0,122500.0,Maxton,Robeson,

Swannanoa River Road serves as the principal east-west corridor for emergency services and access to Mission Hospital and Mission Children's Hospital. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to evaluate the flood mitigation and flood damage reduction benefits of potential actions through hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, updating the Structure Inventory Database, developing a conceptual plan and feasibility analysis, and implementation cost estimates for the potential floodplain modifications. NCDOT State Transportation Improvement Program has allocated $48M for Swannanoa River Roadway corridor modernization in future years. The City will also pursue FEMA Flood Mitigation and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities funding for buyouts and floodplain restoration. City and County Metropolitan Sewerage District capital improvement funds can be used for utility relocations in the corridor.

Failure of the culvert would lead to the development of a sinkhole, loss of the road, area flooding and potential property damage for residents. Loss of the road would also prevent access for emergency services. An existing sewer line could also be undermined causing failure resulting in loss of services as well as wastewater entering the channel. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to replace the existing damaged culvert. The project will include removal of the failing corrugated metal pipe and replace it with reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The culvert will be extended upstream of the crossing. The extension will provide protection to the adjacent sewer line. Downstream of the culvert crossing, two driveway culvert crossings will be abandoned in place and the new RCP installed with tie-in to the proposed headwall. Stream realignment and stabilization grading both upstream and downstream will better direct flow and prevent further erosion. Households located in the immediate project area in the section of Thomas Drake Court from the culvert crossing northward to the cul-de-sac will directly benefit from this project.",Town of Kernersville,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/20/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Kernersville,Forsyth,

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

During flooding events along Weeks Street, emergency vehicles are unable to access residences and surrounding roads (including Highway 24) are overtopped. A 2020 preliminary drainage feasibility study found that flooding is likely caused by an undersized pipe system with minimal elevation change. Currently, the existing drainage route runs along Weeks Street into the drainage route from Smithfield Packing Company. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to reroute the existing drainage system into a separate path to cross Highway 24 and into an existing farm ditch. Additional curb inlets and reinforced concrete pipe will be installed to support the design. City and other funds will be used to improve the existing farm ditch which currently collects runoff.

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

In 2014, a preliminary engineering report was conducted along these roads to determine optimal solutions to reduce flooding in the area. A 2021 stormwater management master plan prioritized this project. When flooding occurs in this area, homes experience flooding for multiple days. Boiling Spring Lakes will use Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds to install stormwater infrastructure along the areas of Holly, Walnut, and Redwood roads. Project activities include digging approximately 3,000 linear feet of drainage ditches with the installation of driveway pipes and several spans of reinforced concrete pipe. Households in the project area will benefit from this project.",City of Boiling Springs Lakes,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/9/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,8/4/22,250000.0,250000.0,Boiling Springs Lakes,Brunswick,

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

Failure of the culvert would lead to the development of a sinkhole, loss of the road, area flooding and potential property damage for residents. Loss of the road would also prevent access for emergency services. An existing sewer line could also be undermined causing failure resulting in loss of services as well as wastewater entering the channel. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to replace the existing damaged culvert. The project will include removal of the failing corrugated metal pipe and replace it with reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The culvert will be extended upstream of the crossing. The extension will provide protection to the adjacent sewer line. Downstream of the culvert crossing, two driveway culvert crossings will be abandoned in place and the new RCP installed with tie-in to the proposed headwall. Stream realignment and stabilization grading both upstream and downstream will better direct flow and prevent further erosion. Households located in the immediate project area in the section of Thomas Drake Court from the culvert crossing northward to the cul-de-sac will directly benefit from this project.",Town of Kernersville,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/20/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Kernersville,Forsyth,

During flooding events along Weeks Street, emergency vehicles are unable to access residences and surrounding roads (including Highway 24) are overtopped. A 2020 preliminary drainage feasibility study found that flooding is likely caused by an undersized pipe system with minimal elevation change. Currently, the existing drainage route runs along Weeks Street into the drainage route from Smithfield Packing Company. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to reroute the existing drainage system into a separate path to cross Highway 24 and into an existing farm ditch.

The park currently experiences frequent flooding during heavy rainfall events resulting in standing water and sediment deposition around the athletic field and on the majority of the walking trail encompassing the outer park boundary. Area residents also report flooding impacting their property. The city had a detailed assessment of the watershed conducted, including hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to determine necessary improvements. The overall proposed project involves two phases. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to support implementation of Phase I which includes stream restoration for East Prong Hunting Creek including excavating a lower floodplain at the elevation of the existing incised stream channel, excavating floodplain benches along the new stream alignment to provide increased flow capacity, establishing a riparian buffer along the banks of East Prong Hunting Creek, constructing bioretention swales to direct overbank stormwater flows into the streams, replacing an existing bridge once the stream is widened, redesigning an existing culvert to improve flow, relocating an existing dog park away from the stream to reduce the pollutant load to downstream receiving waters, and elevating recreational areas such as the athletic field and walking track to mitigate flood impacts on the most used open areas. Additional funding for Phase 1 was awarded by the North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant in 2021 as well as match funding from the City. There are households located in the immediate project area that will benefit from completion of this project. ",City of Morganton,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/31/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Morganton,Burke,

Following Hurricane Florence, the town contracted with an engineer to investigate the area, assess elevations, and make recommendations to improve drainage to reduce flooding. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to implement Phase II of the project, re-grading and resloping natural drainage infrastructure (ditches) throughout the community. Completion of Phase II will ensure that water flows efficiently and effectively to mitigate flooding. All of the work will be done within the town's rights-of-way or within stormwater outfall lines already owned by the town. The town will contribute funds to complete the project. There are households located in the immediate project areas, with additional households in the neighborhood that will also benefit from reduced flooding after completion of Phase II. This project will also reduce flooding on a primary road through the development. ",Town of River Bend,Local Government,Infrastructure,3/14/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,6/2/22,250000.0,250000.0,River Bend,Craven,

The flooding can take up to 2 weeks to fully dewater. In 2020, the city completed a multiphase feasibility study to create the Duffyfield Resiliency Improvement Initiative. Retrofitting of the stormwater pump station on Rose Street was identified as one of the projects to reduce repetitive flooding in this area. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to modify the existing stormwater pump to allow for better mitigation against larger storm events and lowering the water levels in the Duffyfield community. The city is currently pursuing funding from the NC Land and Water Fund, the NC DOJ Environmental Enhancement Grant, and a Resilient Coastal Communities Grant to implement strategies identified.

During flooding events along Weeks Street, emergency vehicles are unable to access residences and surrounding roads (including Highway 24) are overtopped. A 2020 preliminary drainage feasibility study found that flooding is likely caused by an undersized pipe system with minimal elevation change. Currently, the existing drainage route runs along Weeks Street into the drainage route from Smithfield Packing Company. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to reroute the existing drainage system into a separate path to cross Highway 24 and into an existing farm ditch.

The park currently experiences frequent flooding during heavy rainfall events resulting in standing water and sediment deposition around the athletic field and on the majority of the walking trail encompassing the outer park boundary. Area residents also report flooding impacting their property. The city had a detailed assessment of the watershed conducted, including hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to determine necessary improvements. The overall proposed project involves two phases. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to support implementation of Phase I which includes stream restoration for East Prong Hunting Creek including excavating a lower floodplain at the elevation of the existing incised stream channel, excavating floodplain benches along the new stream alignment to provide increased flow capacity, establishing a riparian buffer along the banks of East Prong Hunting Creek, constructing bioretention swales to direct overbank stormwater flows into the streams, replacing an existing bridge once the stream is widened, redesigning an existing culvert to improve flow, relocating an existing dog park away from the stream to reduce the pollutant load to downstream receiving waters, and elevating recreational areas such as the athletic field and walking track to mitigate flood impacts on the most used open areas. Additional funding for Phase 1 was awarded by the North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant in 2021 as well as match funding from the City.

After Hurricane Matthew, NCDOT and Dare County completed the 2019 Roanoke Island Flooding Analysis which proposed drainage improvements. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to incorporate recommendations to upsize pipes and implement other improvements to the area. Areas upstream flood more frequently and the study determined undersized piping in the project area slowed the drainage of those properties. Proposed work includes replacing 150 linear feet of existing pipe with a larger size, enclosing the ditch within Roanoke Colony with drainage pipe with drop inlets, replacing the culvert beneath Roanoke Trail, removing the culvert immediately downstream of the airport property, and regrading/widening the ditch that runs between the Outer Banks SPCA and airport. Homes located in the upstream area identified in the analysis will benefit from this project.",Dare County,Local Government,Infrastructure,6/23/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,County,Dare,

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it.

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan. All residents of the town will benefit from this project. Within the immediate project area there are households, businesses, other public and private entities, and health care providers that will benefit from this project.",Town of Maxton,Local Government,Planning,7/7/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,122500.0,122500.0,Maxton,Robeson,

Following Hurricane Florence, the town contracted with an engineer to investigate the area, assess elevations, and make recommendations to improve drainage to reduce flooding. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to implement Phase II of the project, re-grading and resloping natural drainage infrastructure (ditches) throughout the community. Completion of Phase II will ensure that water flows efficiently and effectively to mitigate flooding. All of the work will be done within the town's rights-of-way or within stormwater outfall lines already owned by the town. The town will contribute funds to complete the project. There are households located in the immediate project areas, with additional households in the neighborhood that will also benefit from reduced flooding after completion of Phase II. This project will also reduce flooding on a primary road through the development. ",Town of River Bend,Local Government,Infrastructure,3/14/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,6/2/22,250000.0,250000.0,River Bend,Craven,

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area. Once the infrastructure work is completed, the city will be able to utilize the road more reliably for emergency services.

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan.

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

Flooding along the tributary causes nearby businesses to experience property damage and roadways to flood resulting in loss of access by the public. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used for necessary analysis to determine a list of priority projects for flood and stormwater mitigation. The town and business owners in the area will be responsible for implementation. The town is also committing to the creation of a stormwater utility fund. Businesses and households in the area will benefit from this project.,Town of Siler City,Local Government,Planning,3/29/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,210000.0,210000.0,Siler City,Chatham,

The town is separated in four quadrants that are separated by railroads crossing through the center of town. Each quadrant has its own individual internal drainage creating a bowl type system. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a stormwater master plan for the Town of Selma in the northeastern quadrant. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. Within this quadrant there are households, businesses, other public and private facilities, and healthcare facilities that will benefit from this project. Additionally, the Town Hall, the Selma Fire Department, and the historic Rudy Theater are located in this area. The roads around the fire and EMS stations become impassable. Access to US highway 301 also becomes restricted during flood events. ",Town of Selma,Local Government,Planning,7/7/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,137500.0,137500.0,Selma,Johnston,

After Hurricane Matthew, NCDOT and Dare County completed the 2019 Roanoke Island Flooding Analysis which proposed drainage improvements. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to incorporate recommendations to upsize pipes and implement other improvements to the area. Areas upstream flood more frequently and the study determined undersized piping in the project area slowed the drainage of those properties. Proposed work includes replacing 150 linear feet of existing pipe with a larger size, enclosing the ditch within Roanoke Colony with drainage pipe with drop inlets, replacing the culvert beneath Roanoke Trail, removing the culvert immediately downstream of the airport property, and regrading/widening the ditch that runs between the Outer Banks SPCA and airport. Homes located in the upstream area identified in the analysis will benefit from this project.",Dare County,Local Government,Infrastructure,6/23/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,County,Dare,

During flooding events along Weeks Street, emergency vehicles are unable to access residences and surrounding roads (including Highway 24) are overtopped. A 2020 preliminary drainage feasibility study found that flooding is likely caused by an undersized pipe system with minimal elevation change. Currently, the existing drainage route runs along Weeks Street into the drainage route from Smithfield Packing Company. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to reroute the existing drainage system into a separate path to cross Highway 24 and into an existing farm ditch. Additional curb inlets and reinforced concrete pipe will be installed to support the design. City and other funds will be used to improve the existing farm ditch which currently collects runoff. Households in the project area and vehicles traveling on adjacent roads will benefit from this project.",Town of Clinton,Local Government,Infrastructure,2/28/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,8/4/22,250000.0,250000.0,Clinton,Sampson,

The park currently experiences frequent flooding during heavy rainfall events resulting in standing water and sediment deposition around the athletic field and on the majority of the walking trail encompassing the outer park boundary. Area residents also report flooding impacting their property. The city had a detailed assessment of the watershed conducted, including hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to determine necessary improvements. The overall proposed project involves two phases. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to support implementation of Phase I which includes stream restoration for East Prong Hunting Creek including excavating a lower floodplain at the elevation of the existing incised stream channel, excavating floodplain benches along the new stream alignment to provide increased flow capacity, establishing a riparian buffer along the banks of East Prong Hunting Creek, constructing bioretention swales to direct overbank stormwater flows into the streams, replacing an existing bridge once the stream is widened, redesigning an existing culvert to improve flow, relocating an existing dog park away from the stream to reduce the pollutant load to downstream receiving waters, and elevating recreational areas such as the athletic field and walking track to mitigate flood impacts on the most used open areas. Additional funding for Phase 1 was awarded by the North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant in 2021 as well as match funding from the City.

When flooding occurs along Adkin Branch, residents are restricted from accessing emergency services and nearby medical offices. The city will use Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds to review existing data sources, collect additional data from field surveys, begin permitting processes, and to update existing models as needed. The city will also use funds for project coordination, and to develop a plan for flood mitigation solutions. The city has committed to funding remaining costs associated with this project from its stormwater utility fund. The city has also received funding from North Carolina Emergency Management for Stage 2 improvements along Adkin Branch.

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

Flooding along the tributary causes nearby businesses to experience property damage and roadways to flood resulting in loss of access by the public. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used for necessary analysis to determine a list of priority projects for flood and stormwater mitigation. The town and business owners in the area will be responsible for implementation. The town is also committing to the creation of a stormwater utility fund.

Stormwater runoff is trapped on the road by higher elevation of driveways serving houses along the road. Heavy rainfall causes flooding that obstructs passage of vehicles, including public safety vehicles. This road is the only way in and out of southern Surf City and serves the entirety of Topsail Beach. A feasibility study of the overall stormwater issues along South Shore Drive developed a specific solution to address the issue. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install a catch basin with drain pipe to convey stormwater to a new infiltration chamber system that collects and releases stormwater back into native soils. Once completed, the town’s utilities staff will maintain the system.

After Hurricane Matthew, NCDOT and Dare County completed the 2019 Roanoke Island Flooding Analysis which proposed drainage improvements. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to incorporate recommendations to upsize pipes and implement other improvements to the area. Areas upstream flood more frequently and the study determined undersized piping in the project area slowed the drainage of those properties. Proposed work includes replacing 150 linear feet of existing pipe with a larger size, enclosing the ditch within Roanoke Colony with drainage pipe with drop inlets, replacing the culvert beneath Roanoke Trail, removing the culvert immediately downstream of the airport property, and regrading/widening the ditch that runs between the Outer Banks SPCA and airport.

Following Hurricane Florence, the town contracted with an engineer to investigate the area, assess elevations, and make recommendations to improve drainage to reduce flooding. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to implement Phase II of the project, re-grading and resloping natural drainage infrastructure (ditches) throughout the community. Completion of Phase II will ensure that water flows efficiently and effectively to mitigate flooding. All of the work will be done within the town's rights-of-way or within stormwater outfall lines already owned by the town. The town will contribute funds to complete the project.

The flooding can take up to 2 weeks to fully dewater. In 2020, the city completed a multiphase feasibility study to create the Duffyfield Resiliency Improvement Initiative. Retrofitting of the stormwater pump station on Rose Street was identified as one of the projects to reduce repetitive flooding in this area. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to modify the existing stormwater pump to allow for better mitigation against larger storm events and lowering the water levels in the Duffyfield community. The city is currently pursuing funding from the NC Land and Water Fund, the NC DOJ Environmental Enhancement Grant, and a Resilient Coastal Communities Grant to implement strategies identified. There are households, businesses, other public and private entities, and a healthcare facility that are in the immediate project area that will benefit from this project. ",City of New Bern,Local Government,Infrastructure,6/30/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,249760.0,249760.0,New Bern,Craven,

Conditions are attributed to stormwater infrastructure collapsed or shifted by severe flooding during hurricanes that prevents runoff from draining properly. The town will use Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds to perform necessary field data collection and performance modeling of existing watersheds, map the location and condition of stormwater assets, and develop concept plans and alternatives that will allow the town to identify and prioritize improvement options and create opinions of probable cost. Development of a stormwater master plan will serve the entire town, though modeling and improvements will focus on three sub-watersheds that drain into Jennie's Gut, Perquimans River, and Lakers Creek. Frequent flooding around Stokes, White, and Front streets make stormwater improvements in these areas a priority. Once completed, the town will incorporate recommendations into annual capital improvement planning and pursue grant funds to implement recommendations. The majority of the town will benefit from this project.",Town of Hertford,Local Government,Planning,6/9/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,8/4/22,90000.0,90000.0,Hertford,Perquimans,

The park currently experiences frequent flooding during heavy rainfall events resulting in standing water and sediment deposition around the athletic field and on the majority of the walking trail encompassing the outer park boundary. Area residents also report flooding impacting their property. The city had a detailed assessment of the watershed conducted, including hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to determine necessary improvements. The overall proposed project involves two phases. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to support implementation of Phase I which includes stream restoration for East Prong Hunting Creek including excavating a lower floodplain at the elevation of the existing incised stream channel, excavating floodplain benches along the new stream alignment to provide increased flow capacity, establishing a riparian buffer along the banks of East Prong Hunting Creek, constructing bioretention swales to direct overbank stormwater flows into the streams, replacing an existing bridge once the stream is widened, redesigning an existing culvert to improve flow, relocating an existing dog park away from the stream to reduce the pollutant load to downstream receiving waters, and elevating recreational areas such as the athletic field and walking track to mitigate flood impacts on the most used open areas. Additional funding for Phase 1 was awarded by the North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant in 2021 as well as match funding from the City. There are households located in the immediate project area that will benefit from completion of this project. ",City of Morganton,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/31/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Morganton,Burke,

The park currently experiences frequent flooding during heavy rainfall events resulting in standing water and sediment deposition around the athletic field and on the majority of the walking trail encompassing the outer park boundary. Area residents also report flooding impacting their property. The city had a detailed assessment of the watershed conducted, including hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to determine necessary improvements. The overall proposed project involves two phases. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to support implementation of Phase I which includes stream restoration for East Prong Hunting Creek including excavating a lower floodplain at the elevation of the existing incised stream channel, excavating floodplain benches along the new stream alignment to provide increased flow capacity, establishing a riparian buffer along the banks of East Prong Hunting Creek, constructing bioretention swales to direct overbank stormwater flows into the streams, replacing an existing bridge once the stream is widened, redesigning an existing culvert to improve flow, relocating an existing dog park away from the stream to reduce the pollutant load to downstream receiving waters, and elevating recreational areas such as the athletic field and walking track to mitigate flood impacts on the most used open areas. Additional funding for Phase 1 was awarded by the North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant in 2021 as well as match funding from the City. There are households located in the immediate project area that will benefit from completion of this project. ",City of Morganton,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/31/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Morganton,Burke,

Following Hurricane Florence, the town contracted with an engineer to investigate the area, assess elevations, and make recommendations to improve drainage to reduce flooding. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to implement Phase II of the project, re-grading and resloping natural drainage infrastructure (ditches) throughout the community. Completion of Phase II will ensure that water flows efficiently and effectively to mitigate flooding. All of the work will be done within the town's rights-of-way or within stormwater outfall lines already owned by the town. The town will contribute funds to complete the project. There are households located in the immediate project areas, with additional households in the neighborhood that will also benefit from reduced flooding after completion of Phase II. This project will also reduce flooding on a primary road through the development. ",Town of River Bend,Local Government,Infrastructure,3/14/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,6/2/22,250000.0,250000.0,River Bend,Craven,

During flooding events along Weeks Street, emergency vehicles are unable to access residences and surrounding roads (including Highway 24) are overtopped. A 2020 preliminary drainage feasibility study found that flooding is likely caused by an undersized pipe system with minimal elevation change. Currently, the existing drainage route runs along Weeks Street into the drainage route from Smithfield Packing Company. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to reroute the existing drainage system into a separate path to cross Highway 24 and into an existing farm ditch.

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

Failure of the culvert would lead to the development of a sinkhole, loss of the road, area flooding and potential property damage for residents. Loss of the road would also prevent access for emergency services. An existing sewer line could also be undermined causing failure resulting in loss of services as well as wastewater entering the channel. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to replace the existing damaged culvert. The project will include removal of the failing corrugated metal pipe and replace it with reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The culvert will be extended upstream of the crossing. The extension will provide protection to the adjacent sewer line. Downstream of the culvert crossing, two driveway culvert crossings will be abandoned in place and the new RCP installed with tie-in to the proposed headwall. Stream realignment and stabilization grading both upstream and downstream will better direct flow and prevent further erosion.

Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to incorporate recommendations to upsize pipes and implement other improvements to the area. Areas upstream flood more frequently and the study determined undersized piping in the project area slowed the drainage of those properties. Proposed work includes replacing 150 linear feet of existing pipe with a larger size, enclosing the ditch within Roanoke Colony with drainage pipe with drop inlets, replacing the culvert beneath Roanoke Trail, removing the culvert immediately downstream of the airport property, and regrading/widening the ditch that runs between the Outer Banks SPCA and airport.

After Hurricane Matthew, NCDOT and Dare County completed the 2019 Roanoke Island Flooding Analysis which proposed drainage improvements. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to incorporate recommendations to upsize pipes and implement other improvements to the area. Areas upstream flood more frequently and the study determined undersized piping in the project area slowed the drainage of those properties. Proposed work includes replacing 150 linear feet of existing pipe with a larger size, enclosing the ditch within Roanoke Colony with drainage pipe with drop inlets, replacing the culvert beneath Roanoke Trail, removing the culvert immediately downstream of the airport property, and regrading/widening the ditch that runs between the Outer Banks SPCA and airport. Homes located in the upstream area identified in the analysis will benefit from this project.",Dare County,Local Government,Infrastructure,6/23/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,County,Dare,

Failure of the culvert would lead to the development of a sinkhole, loss of the road, area flooding and potential property damage for residents. Loss of the road would also prevent access for emergency services. An existing sewer line could also be undermined causing failure resulting in loss of services as well as wastewater entering the channel. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to replace the existing damaged culvert. The project will include removal of the failing corrugated metal pipe and replace it with reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The culvert will be extended upstream of the crossing. The extension will provide protection to the adjacent sewer line. Downstream of the culvert crossing, two driveway culvert crossings will be abandoned in place and the new RCP installed with tie-in to the proposed headwall. Stream realignment and stabilization grading both upstream and downstream will better direct flow and prevent further erosion.

The town began to recognize how severe the stormwater system’s limitations are after a major rainstorm in 2020. Following the rain event, the town identified several areas of inadequate and damaged stormwater infrastructure. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used for engineering expenses for analysis and planning regarding ten flooding hotspots. There are households, public and private entities within the immediate project area of the identified hotspots. The entire town will benefit from this project.

Stormwater runoff is trapped on the road by higher elevation of driveways serving houses along the road. Heavy rainfall causes flooding that obstructs passage of vehicles, including public safety vehicles. This road is the only way in and out of southern Surf City and serves the entirety of Topsail Beach. A feasibility study of the overall stormwater issues along South Shore Drive developed a specific solution to address the issue. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install a catch basin with drain pipe to convey stormwater to a new infiltration chamber system that collects and releases stormwater back into native soils. Once completed, the town’s utilities staff will maintain the system. The project will directly serve households, and public and private entities.",Town of Surf City,Local Government,Infrastructure,2/25/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,6/2/22,250000.0,250000.0,Surf City,Pender,

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area.

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan.

Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan. All residents of the town will benefit from this project. Within the immediate project area there are households, businesses, other public and private entities, and health care providers that will benefit from this project.",Town of Maxton,Local Government,Planning,7/7/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,122500.0,122500.0,Maxton,Robeson,

Continued flooding has resulted in caving in and widening of the canal which is now in danger of undermining nearby houses. Previous efforts by the Town to haul in dirt to shore up the bank have not provided a viable long term solution. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install sheet piling and rip rap along the bank to stop erosion, improve the transport of stormwater, and significantly reduce flooding along the canal. This canal carries one third of total stormwater for the town and connects downstream to the main branch of Little Rockfish Creek, which is the town’s main drainage area. There are two households in the immediate project area. The flooding and erosion also threaten a main sewer line that crosses over and runs parallel to the canal,  and which must be inspected for damage and exposure after each heavy rain event.

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area. Once the infrastructure work is completed, the city will be able to utilize the road more reliably for emergency services.

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area. Once the infrastructure work is completed, the city will be able to utilize the road more reliably for emergency services. There are households, public and private entities (including a kidney dialysis center), and a nursing facility in the immediate project area.",City of Lumberton,Local Government,Infrastructure,2/28/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,6/2/22,250000.0,250000.0,Lumberton,Robeson,

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan.

The town is separated in four quadrants that are separated by railroads crossing through the center of town. Each quadrant has its own individual internal drainage creating a bowl type system. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a stormwater master plan for the Town of Selma in the northeastern quadrant. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. Within this quadrant there are households, businesses, other public and private facilities, and healthcare facilities that will benefit from this project. Additionally, the Town Hall, the Selma Fire Department, and the historic Rudy Theater are located in this area. The roads around the fire and EMS stations become impassable. Access to US highway 301 also becomes restricted during flood events. ",Town of Selma,Local Government,Planning,7/7/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,137500.0,137500.0,Selma,Johnston,

Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used for a watershed study for the Little Long Creek 2 sub-basin. Components of this study include field investigation, stormwater inventory, H&H modeling, analysis of secondary systems, and the development of a watershed master plan. With the development of the master plan, the city plans to perform cost benefit analysis and priority rankings to aid staff in its implementation. Once completed, the city will be able to prioritize projects to undertake along this watershed. The city plans to fund these projects through an enterprise fund with the development of a stormwater management program and anticipates collecting fees for this program beginning in January 2023. In this project area there are households, businesses, and other public and private entities that will benefit from the completion of this project. ",City of Albemarle,Local Government,Planning,6/15/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Albemarle,Stanly,

Swannanoa River Road serves as the principal east-west corridor for emergency services and access to Mission Hospital and Mission Children's Hospital. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to evaluate the flood mitigation and flood damage reduction benefits of potential actions through hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, updating the Structure Inventory Database, developing a conceptual plan and feasibility analysis, and implementation cost estimates for the potential floodplain modifications. NCDOT State Transportation Improvement Program has allocated $48M for Swannanoa River Roadway corridor modernization in future years. The City will also pursue FEMA Flood Mitigation and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities funding for buyouts and floodplain restoration. City and County Metropolitan Sewerage District capital improvement funds can be used for utility relocations in the corridor.

The park currently experiences frequent flooding during heavy rainfall events resulting in standing water and sediment deposition around the athletic field and on the majority of the walking trail encompassing the outer park boundary. Area residents also report flooding impacting their property. The city had a detailed assessment of the watershed conducted, including hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to determine necessary improvements. The overall proposed project involves two phases. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to support implementation of Phase I which includes stream restoration for East Prong Hunting Creek including excavating a lower floodplain at the elevation of the existing incised stream channel, excavating floodplain benches along the new stream alignment to provide increased flow capacity, establishing a riparian buffer along the banks of East Prong Hunting Creek, constructing bioretention swales to direct overbank stormwater flows into the streams, replacing an existing bridge once the stream is widened, redesigning an existing culvert to improve flow, relocating an existing dog park away from the stream to reduce the pollutant load to downstream receiving waters, and elevating recreational areas such as the athletic field and walking track to mitigate flood impacts on the most used open areas. Additional funding for Phase 1 was awarded by the North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant in 2021 as well as match funding from the City. There are households located in the immediate project area that will benefit from completion of this project. ",City of Morganton,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/31/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,250000.0,250000.0,Morganton,Burke,

Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to incorporate recommendations to upsize pipes and implement other improvements to the area. Areas upstream flood more frequently and the study determined undersized piping in the project area slowed the drainage of those properties. Proposed work includes replacing 150 linear feet of existing pipe with a larger size, enclosing the ditch within Roanoke Colony with drainage pipe with drop inlets, replacing the culvert beneath Roanoke Trail, removing the culvert immediately downstream of the airport property, and regrading/widening the ditch that runs between the Outer Banks SPCA and airport.

The city completed several studies to develop strategies to resolve flooding throughout the city. This project area is part of its existing studies and is located along a major thoroughfare that is in a 518-acre drainage area. The specific project site is at the downstream end of a drainage ditch that has larger pipes upstream. Due to the undersized existing piping, this project site creates a bottleneck for stormwater flow. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to upsize the capacity of stormwater at the juncture of Linkhaw Rd and the railroad. The applicant proposes to install stormwater infrastructure to increase the capacity of the flow under the railroad which will require widening the canal to accommodate it. The stormwater will flow into a culvert downstream and into an existing impoundment area.

The town first noticed damage to its system when severe damage occurred following Hurricane Matthew. FEMA addressed many issues in this part of town, including repairs to streets and culverts, but determined the conveyance pipe experienced damage that predated Hurricane Matthew and was not eligible for FEMA funding. Due to this evidence, the town realized other sites have likely experienced damage to infrastructure that was not as dramatically exposed as the damage noticed following Hurricane Matthew. Flooding has affected the town in a number of different ways. Access to emergency services becomes impacted, natural swales throughout the town have filled with sediment, which causes conveyance of the stormwater to no longer flow as it was intended. Sinkholes and depressions have also begun to form around stormwater conveyance pipes due to fractures in the system. Additionally, the town has experienced flooding events that flood the gym and adjacent classrooms in the local elementary school. The railroad running through town has also been overtopped during flooding events. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a Stormwater Assessment and Plan for the eastern half of the town. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. The town has also provided a resolution to its commitment for a funding strategy to implement improvements that are identified in the stormwater comprehensive plan. All residents of the town will benefit from this project. Within the immediate project area there are households, businesses, other public and private entities, and health care providers that will benefit from this project.",Town of Maxton,Local Government,Planning,7/7/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,122500.0,122500.0,Maxton,Robeson,

To create a master plan, the applicant is requesting Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds to map stormwater infrastructure within the entire jurisdiction and perform modeling along sub-basins west and parallel to College Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. Additional data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, and the development of concept plans and alternatives will also be completed.

Following Hurricane Florence, the town contracted with an engineer to investigate the area, assess elevations, and make recommendations to improve drainage to reduce flooding. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to implement Phase II of the project, re-grading and resloping natural drainage infrastructure (ditches) throughout the community. Completion of Phase II will ensure that water flows efficiently and effectively to mitigate flooding. All of the work will be done within the town's rights-of-way or within stormwater outfall lines already owned by the town. The town will contribute funds to complete the project. There are households located in the immediate project areas, with additional households in the neighborhood that will also benefit from reduced flooding after completion of Phase II. This project will also reduce flooding on a primary road through the development. ",Town of River Bend,Local Government,Infrastructure,3/14/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,6/2/22,250000.0,250000.0,River Bend,Craven,

The flooding can take up to 2 weeks to fully dewater. In 2020, the city completed a multiphase feasibility study to create the Duffyfield Resiliency Improvement Initiative. Retrofitting of the stormwater pump station on Rose Street was identified as one of the projects to reduce repetitive flooding in this area. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to modify the existing stormwater pump to allow for better mitigation against larger storm events and lowering the water levels in the Duffyfield community. The city is currently pursuing funding from the NC Land and Water Fund, the NC DOJ Environmental Enhancement Grant, and a Resilient Coastal Communities Grant to implement strategies identified. There are households, businesses, other public and private entities, and a healthcare facility that are in the immediate project area that will benefit from this project. ",City of New Bern,Local Government,Infrastructure,6/30/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,249760.0,249760.0,New Bern,Craven,

The town is separated in four quadrants that are separated by railroads crossing through the center of town. Each quadrant has its own individual internal drainage creating a bowl type system. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a stormwater master plan for the Town of Selma in the northeastern quadrant. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. Within this quadrant there are households, businesses, other public and private facilities, and healthcare facilities that will benefit from this project. Additionally, the Town Hall, the Selma Fire Department, and the historic Rudy Theater are located in this area. The roads around the fire and EMS stations become impassable. Access to US highway 301 also becomes restricted during flood events. ",Town of Selma,Local Government,Planning,7/7/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,10/6/22,137500.0,137500.0,Selma,Johnston,

The town is separated in four quadrants that are separated by railroads crossing through the center of town. Each quadrant has its own individual internal drainage creating a bowl type system. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to develop a stormwater master plan for the Town of Selma in the northeastern quadrant. Components of this project include field data collection, modeling of existing watersheds, development of concept plans and alternatives, and a summary report. Within this quadrant there are households, businesses, other public and private facilities, and healthcare facilities that will benefit from this project.

Streets and residential properties in the area are often left flooded for extended periods of time. Golden LEAF flood mitigation grant funds will be used to install infrastructure to enclose the ditch and improve drainage to eliminate flooding in the area. An exposed water line running along the slope of the ditch will be abandoned and water services will be reconnected to existing water lines located upstream. Households and vehicles traveling on adjacent roads in the immediate project area will benefit from this project.,Town of Tabor City,Local Government,Infrastructure,5/10/22,Golden LEAF Foundation Flood Mitigation Program,,,2022.0,8/4/22,175000.0,175000.0,Tabor City,Columbus,
